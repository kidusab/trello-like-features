# Task 5: Project & Task Management System

## Objective
Implement the complete project and task management system with CRUD operations and assignment functionality.

## Deliverables
1. **Project Management GraphQL Mutations**
   - createProject - Requires Workspace Member or Owner role
   - updateProject - Update project details
   - deleteProject - Requires Project Lead or Workspace Owner role
   - updateProjectMemberRole - Change user's role within specific project

2. **Task Management GraphQL Mutations**
   - createTask - Requires Project Contributor or Project Lead role
   - updateTask - Update task details, status, assignments
   - deleteTask - Requires Project Contributor or Project Lead role
   - assignTask - Assign/reassign tasks to users

3. **Task Assignment & Notification System**
   - Automatic notification creation when tasks are assigned
   - Notification status tracking (DELIVERED, SEEN)
   - Notification management mutations (mark as seen)

4. **Project & Task GraphQL Queries**
   - getProject - Retrieve project with tasks
   - getTask - Retrieve individual task details
   - getUserTasks - Get tasks assigned to current user
   - getProjectTasks - Get all tasks in a project

5. **Data Validation & Business Logic**
   - Task status validation (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE)
   - Assignment validation (users must be project members)
   - Project membership validation (users must be workspace members)

## Technical Requirements
- Implement proper authorization checks for all operations
- Use database transactions for complex operations
- Create notification entries automatically on task assignment
- Validate all input data and business rules
- Handle many-to-many relationships (tasks to users)

## Success Criteria
- Users can create, update, and delete projects within their workspaces
- Task CRUD operations work with proper permission checks
- Task assignments trigger notifications correctly
- Project membership roles are enforced
- All operations respect the authorization hierarchy
- Data integrity is maintained across all operations

## Estimated Time
5-6 hours
