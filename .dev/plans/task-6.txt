# Task 6: Real-time GraphQL Subscriptions

## Objective
Implement GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates when task statuses change within workspaces.

## Deliverables
1. **GraphQL Subscription Setup**
   - Configure Apollo Server with subscription support
   - Set up WebSocket connection handling
   - Implement subscription authentication middleware

2. **Task Status Update Subscription**
   - taskStatusUpdated(workspaceId: ID!): Task
   - Filter subscriptions by workspaceId
   - Send updates only to workspace members
   - Include necessary task data in payload

3. **Real-time Event Triggers**
   - Hook into task update mutations
   - Detect status changes (TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE)
   - Publish events to appropriate subscribers
   - Handle subscription cleanup and error handling

4. **Subscription Management**
   - User connection tracking
   - Workspace membership verification for subscriptions
   - Handle connection drops and reconnections
   - Implement subscription authorization

5. **Testing Real-time Features**
   - Test subscription with multiple clients
   - Verify workspace filtering works correctly
   - Test authentication with subscriptions
   - Verify proper cleanup on disconnect

## Technical Requirements
- Use Apollo Server subscriptions with WebSocket
- Implement proper authentication for subscriptions
- Use PubSub or similar for event publishing
- Handle subscription lifecycle properly
- Filter events by workspace membership

## Success Criteria
- Users can subscribe to task status updates for their workspaces
- Real-time updates are sent only to workspace members
- Subscription authentication works correctly
- Multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- Proper cleanup when clients disconnect
- Events are filtered correctly by workspaceId
