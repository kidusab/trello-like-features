# Task 7: Secure Dual Logging System

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive logging system that writes to both files and database for security monitoring and compliance.

## Deliverables
1. **Logging Service Setup**
   - Configure Winston logger for file logging
   - Set up database logging to auditLogs table
   - Create logging utility functions
   - Implement log rotation and management

2. **File Logging (audit.log)**
   - Log all activity to local file
   - Include timestamp, severity level, message, User ID
   - Implement log levels: info, warn, error, security
   - Set up log rotation and cleanup

3. **Database Logging (auditLogs table)**
   - Authentication failures with IP addresses
   - Admin actions (user ban/unban, password reset)
   - Critical errors and exceptions
   - Task lifecycle events (status changes)
   - Project/Workspace management events
   - Session management (login/logout, device revocation)

4. **Log Categories Implementation**
   - System Logs: Critical errors, exceptions
   - Security Logs: Auth failures, admin actions
   - User Logs: Session management, user actions
   - Activity Tracker: Task/project/workspace changes

5. **Logging Integration**
   - Integrate logging into all critical operations
   - Add logging middleware for HTTP requests
   - Log GraphQL operations and errors
   - Implement error handling with logging

## Technical Requirements
- Use Winston for file logging with proper configuration
- Implement database logging with structured data
- Create reusable logging functions
- Include IP address tracking where possible
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use structured logging format (JSON)

## Success Criteria
- All critical events are logged to both file and database
- Log entries include all required fields (timestamp, level, userId, etc.)
- Logging works across all application components
- File logs are properly rotated and managed
- Database logs are structured and queryable
- Security events are properly categorized and logged

## Estimated Time
4-5 hours

## Dependencies
Task 2 (Database Schema) - for auditLogs table

## Next Task
Task 8: Testing Implementation (Unit & E2E)
