# Task 8: Testing Implementation (Unit & E2E)

## Objective
Implement comprehensive testing suite including unit tests and end-to-end tests for critical workflows.

## Deliverables
1. **Testing Framework Setup**
   - Configure Jest for unit testing
   - Set up test database (separate from development)
   - Configure test environment variables
   - Set up test utilities and helpers

2. **Unit Tests**
   - JWT token generation and verification
   - Password hashing utilities
   - Authorization logic functions
   - Notification creation logic
   - Logging service functions
   - Database query functions
   - Business logic validation functions

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Authentication Flow: Registration → Login → Token Refresh → Logout
   - Authorization Check: Non-member cannot access restricted workspace
   - Task Management Flow: Create → Assign → Update Status → Notification
   - Workspace Management: Create → Add Member → Change Role → Remove Member
   - Admin Functions: Ban User → Reset Password → Audit Logging

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Database operations with real PostgreSQL
   - GraphQL mutations and queries
   - REST API endpoints
   - Real-time subscription functionality
   - File and database logging

5. **Test Data Management**
   - Create test fixtures and seed data
   - Implement test database cleanup
   - Mock external services (email, AI APIs)
   - Set up test user accounts and workspaces

## Technical Requirements
- Use Jest for unit and integration testing
- Use Supertest for API testing
- Set up separate test database
- Mock external dependencies
- Implement proper test cleanup
- Achieve good test coverage (>80%)

## Success Criteria
- All critical functions have unit tests
- E2E tests cover main user workflows
- Tests run reliably in CI/CD environment
- Test coverage meets requirements
- Tests are maintainable and well-organized
- All tests pass consistently

## Estimated Time
6-7 hours

## Dependencies
Tasks 1-7 (Core functionality to test)

## Next Task
Task 9: CI/CD Pipeline & Docker Setup
