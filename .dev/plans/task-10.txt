# Task 10: AI Integration & Bonus Features

## Objective
Implement AI integration with Gemini API and additional bonus features to demonstrate advanced capabilities.

## Deliverables
1. **AI Integration (Gemini API)**
   - summarizeTask Query: Accept long task description, return 1-2 sentence summary
   - generateTasksFromPrompt Mutation: Accept high-level prompt, generate structured task list
   - Persist AI-generated tasks to specified project
   - Handle AI API errors and rate limiting

2. **Rate Limiting & Security**
   - Implement rate limiting on public endpoints (login, registration)
   - Add brute force attack protection
   - Configure rate limiting middleware
   - Set up IP-based throttling

3. **Push Notifications (VAPID/Firebase)**
   - Set up VAPID keys for web push notifications
   - Implement push notification service
   - Send notifications when tasks are assigned
   - Handle notification delivery and failures

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement graceful shutdown with signal handling
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Set up monitoring and health checks
   - Implement request/response logging

5. **Documentation & Demo**
   - Create comprehensive README.md
   - Document all API endpoints and GraphQL schema
   - Create sample queries and mutations
   - Prepare demonstration materials

## Technical Requirements
- Integrate Gemini API with proper error handling
- Implement rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- Set up web push notifications with web-push library
- Use proper signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Create comprehensive documentation

## Success Criteria
- AI features work correctly with Gemini API
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Push notifications are delivered successfully
- Application shuts down gracefully
- Documentation is complete and clear
- All bonus features are functional

## Estimated Time
5-6 hours

## Dependencies
Tasks 1-9 (Core application functionality)

## Project Completion
This completes the full-stack collaboration platform with all required features and bonus enhancements. The project demonstrates enterprise-level Node.js development skills with security, scalability, and maintainability focus.
