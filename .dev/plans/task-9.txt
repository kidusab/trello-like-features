# Task 9: CI/CD Pipeline & Docker Setup

## Objective
Set up continuous integration/deployment pipeline and containerize the application for easy deployment.

## Deliverables
1. **Docker Configuration**
   - Create Dockerfile for the Node.js/Bun application
   - Create docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL
   - Set up multi-stage build for optimization
   - Configure environment variables for containers

2. **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**
   - Install dependencies (bun install)
   - Run full test suite (Unit and E2E)
   - Build the application
   - Run linting and code quality checks
   - Set up database for testing
   - Deploy to staging environment (optional)

3. **Application Optimization**
   - Implement graceful shutdown handling
   - Add signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
   - Optimize Docker image size
   - Set up health checks for containers

4. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Database migration scripts
   - Production-ready logging configuration
   - Security hardening for containers

5. **Documentation**
   - Docker setup instructions
   - CI/CD pipeline documentation
   - Deployment guide
   - Environment variable documentation

## Technical Requirements
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Create production-ready Docker images
- Implement proper signal handling
- Set up database migrations in containers
- Configure proper logging for production
- Use multi-stage Docker builds

## Success Criteria
- Docker containers start successfully
- CI/CD pipeline runs all tests and builds
- Application handles graceful shutdown
- Database migrations work in containers
- Production deployment is documented
- Security best practices are followed

## Estimated Time
4-5 hours
